# Coding Quiz Challenge

This Coding Quiz Challenge was created using a basic HTML boilerplate and a basic CSS stylesheet, as well as some much more intricate JavaScript. The starter code was provided by the course instructor, and all other work was done by me. When fully functional, this application will serve as a learning tool for how to write JavaScript code. Unfortunately for the time being, I'm up against the deadline and the application will not end when it is supposed to (only when the timer runs out, and even then the user still can't record and display their highscores). I wanted to post and push what I had, although I know this challenge was not completed fully.
